# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
### I created this project to showcase the basic of JavaScript I learned in my coding boot camp class. This assignment taught me a lot about the math.random function and challenged me immensely to  figure out how to randomize the password given the criteria and to include every character that was selected. I also learned a lot about adding notes that would make sense to me and other people considering this was a hard assignment and I constantly was looking back to what I did, and I needed to know why I did something. I learned that the alert function is incredibly annoying and I hope to never use it again.
